    "Over the past year, I have been developing a Python package for automated machine learning (AutoML). While I mainly use the package for standard supervised learning, I have recently begun using it for time series. The workflow is the same: fitting several models and selecting the model with highest out-of-sample accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the time series mode of the package has a few differences. First, instead of standard k-fold cross-validation, the time series mode uses `TimeSeriesSplit` from scikit-learn. Rather than partitioning the data into random folds, `TimeSeriesSplit` uses an expanding window. Each CV iteration evaluates on a test set that follows the training set, while the training set grows to include all prior data:"

    "The other difference with time series mode is the use of automated feature engineering. The tool generates several transformations of the dependent variable – lags, rolling averages, and cyclical features (sine transformations for seasonality) – to use as predictors. My hypothesis was that training ElasticNet and gradient boosting models on these engineered features would yield accurate forecasts. This approach is based in part on my experience with enterprise AutoML platforms like DataRobot, which use a similar methods. \n",
